name = input("Enter the name: ")

print("Good Afternoon", name)       # to add strings after the name, we have add double quotes after name
print("Good Afternoon " + name)     # like print("Good Afternoon" + "      ")
print(f"Good Afternoon {name}")     # so we can use f-string method which can be used to simply add strings after the name
