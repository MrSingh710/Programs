A novel deep-learning algorithm developed by EPFL researchers can differentiate 
between the effects of self-interacting dark matter and active galactic nuclei 
feedback in galaxy clusters with 80% accuracy.

In a significant advancement for astrophysics and cosmology, researchers at the 
École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) have created an artificial 
intelligence algorithm capable of distinguishing the subtle effects of dark 
matter from other cosmic phenomena. This breakthrough, published in Nature 
Astronomy, could revolutionize our understanding of one of the universe’s 
most enigmatic components.
