Dark matter, which makes up approximately 85% of all matter in the 
universe, has long perplexed scientists due to its invisible nature. 
While its gravitational effects on galaxies and cosmic structures 
are observable, directly studying dark matter has proven challenging. 
One leading theory suggests that dark matter particles might occasionally 
interact with each other, a phenomenon known as self-interaction. However, 
detecting these interactions has been difficult due to interference from 
other cosmic effects, particularly those caused by active galactic nuclei (AGN).
